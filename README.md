# FreeDeck-5x3-PCB
This is my PCB design for the 5x3 FreeDeck

You will need:
- Arduino Pro Micro (32u4 16mhz 5v)
- 2x 74HC4067 Multiplexer Breakout Board
- 15x SSD1306 OLEDs
- 15x 6x6x4.3mm buttons
- SPI-SDcard Reader

My custom version of the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/ryanaukes/FreeDeck-5x3-Firmware
The original version will not work because of the pins and the order in which the buttons and screens are connected to the multiplexers.

The original firmware and configurator are developed by Koriwi / FreeYourStream UG (https://github.com/FreeYourStream) and can be found here:
- Firmware: https://github.com/FreeYourStream/freedeck-ino
- Configurator: https://github.com/FreeYourStream/freedeck-configurator
